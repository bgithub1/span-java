span-java contains the following: 

1. code to build the mongo dbs that you need in all of the other commodity analysis projects
associated with LiveRisk and other projects.  

2. An experimental span calculator for CME products
that needs to be finished, but works for many of the major CME products.
See the com.billybyte.spanjava.mains package for java classes with mains that both create the mongo dbs,
and also has the experimental calculator.  The code is self-documenting.
